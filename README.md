Pretty much everything is hardcoded so you might want to adjust the script.

Note: Uses data gathered by BoothDownloader.
Note 2: You must disable AutoZip in the BDConfig.json config.  
Note 3: Translations are made by pesky robots. If something is too cooked, feel free to PR correction.  

Feel free to submit PR's if you fixed something, just keep the colors.

## This script can NOT download any assets, the referenced tool can only download assets you own!
